#ASMS Events Management
####Register for upcoming professional development events at the Australian Science and Mathematics School.

###What is it?

ASMS Events Management gives Australians the ability to rate members of parliament from their electorate.

Users create an account, when invited to an event and are given a list of upcoming events they can attend. Users can attend other events but a lot of events are password protected to prevent uninvited users from attending. If an event does not have a password a user can attend the event. If users have an event they want to attend they click the attend button and the events coordinator will be informed of their status and other details around the user such as diet requirements and contact details.

###Technology Involved
ASMS Events Management is made with Laravel v3. It uses the following technology:

* [**L**aravel](http://www.laravel.com)
* [**M**ySQL](http://www.mysql.com)
* [**A**pache](http://httpd.apache.org)

Each piece of the stack has it's own dependencies and if you're looking at contributing or starting your own project based off of ASMS Events Management it will be best to review each piece of the puzzle and listen to them about requirements and help getting started.
